#26 - LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY IN JSX:
When we use map() method and iterate over items then we have to give a unique 'key' defining item. In here we will be using "url" in "articles" array as unique identifier of each item. That is key={element.url}
and also newsUrl={element.url} as discussed earlier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#27 - USING FETCH API FOR HTTP CALL:
we will bring news directly from newsAPI by making GET request.

https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844
this gives response of top-headlines in india - see https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines

https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844
this gives response of every news in india - see https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

So now will bring news from these endpoints.

componentDidMount() is a life cycle method. This method is run after render() method. And render() method runs after constructor()

Dont fetch from the API url again and again while developing as limit might get exhausted.

can use unsplash api to get image if any image is null in the response to our GET request to newsAPI. but i am using some random image https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/J6_coFbogxhRI9iM864NL_liGXvsQp2AupsKei7z0cNNfDvGUmWUy20nuUhkREQyrpY4bEeIBuc=s0-w300-rw

sampleOutput.json is not required anymore

#28 - ADDING PREVIOUS AND NEXT BUTTON TO POPULATE NEWSITEMS: when we do GET request to 
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844 is same as (https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844&page=1)
we see that "totalResults": 38, but we only see partial number of results, as other results are in page=2
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844&page=2

so we add previous and next button to access that also 

&rarr; -> right arrow
&larr; -> left arrow

pageSize=20 as a parameter in url describes that in one page we will get to see 20 news articles
(totalResults/pageSize) gives the number of pages where we will see results. Beyond this page number we will not see any srticles. 
will use below code in handleNextClik(): 
if(this.state.page+1 > Math.ceil(this.state.totalResults/20)){
   // will do nothing
}
else{
   // will go to next page and display results 
}

example: Math.ceil(4.6) = 5
