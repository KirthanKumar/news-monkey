#29 - ADDING LOADING SPINNER AND VARIABLE PAGESIZE RO NEWSMONKEY: 
this condition says that when loading is false then only display the result. 
{!(this.state.loading) && this.state.articles.map((element) => {
            return (
              <div className="col-md-4" key={element.url}>
                <NewsItem
                  // title={element.title ? element.title.slice(0, 40) : ""}
                  title={element.title ? element.title : ""} // no need to slice it looks good without slicing
                  // description={(element.title.length+element.description.length > 100)?element.description.slice(0, 100-element.title.length):element.description}
                  description={
                    // element.description ? element.description.slice(0, 80) : ""
                    element.description ? element.description : ""
                  }
                  imageUrl={element.urlToImage}
                  newsUrl={element.url}
                />
              </div>
            );
          })}

{this.state.loading && <Spinner />}
this condition says that when loading is true then only show Spinner component.

we change state of loding to true before fetching data from url and set it to false after fetching data from url. By doing this we get a feeling of data loading. 

To delay the reponses from the API we can do network throttling slow down the network speed. goto inspect -> network -> no throttling, now we can select options here. We can also customize in here also.

#30 - ADDING CATEGORIES AND PROP TYPES TO NEWSMONKEY REACT APP:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

FETCHING NEWS CATEGORY WISE IN NEWSMONKEY REACT APP USING REACT ROUTER DOM(see documentation): --pending--
ADDING TIME, AUTHOR AND NEWS SOURCES:
REFACTORING NEWS COMPONENT TO USE THE SAME FUNCTION:
REACT COMPONENT LIFECYCLE AND LIFECYCLE METHODS:
 * The series of events that happen from the mounting of a React component to its Unmounting.
    *Mounting - Birth of your component
    *Update - Grouth of your component
    *Unmount - Death of your component

 Methods in React Component Lifecycle
    * The render() methos is used to render HTML of the component in react. This method is required for a class based component to render the DOM. It runs during the mounting and updating of your component. Render() method should be pure ie you cannot modify state inside it.
    * The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
    * The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens. The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate() method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
    * The componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed. Usually used to perform cleanups.
