#22 - PROJECT 2 SETUP + INTRODUCTION TO CLASS BASED COMPONENTS:

If you want to open any folder in powershell easily: shift + rightClick (double tap in laptop) and choose open with powershell

code . -> in terminal to open that perticular folder in new vs code window.

until now it was function based components now its class based components

rfc -> function based component
rcc -> class based component 

create-react-app by default preffered function based component, we removed it in src/App.js and used class based component.

rcc->
import React, { Component } from 'react';
export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        
      </div>
    );
  }
}

In class based component state, props and other things are a bit different from function based component. If class concept is known then methods management is easier in this.

In this project we will develop a news app using API https://newsapi.org/

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#23 - COMPONENT STRUCTURE OF NEWSMONKEY REACT APP:
rce-> react class export component
import React, { Component } from 'react';
export class Navbar extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default Navbar;

render() function in src/App.js compiles JSX to html and renders it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#24 - FETCHING API KEY FROM NEWS API:
https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started
In here we can see sample request, and response in json format. 

There are two endpoints in this api, we choose 'top headlines': see and understand all sample GET request and responses. https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844

I added json-formatter extension in google chrome.

Instead of performing GET request again and again to see the response for https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&category=sports&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844 . I store the response to this GET request in a sampleOutput.json file to ease while developing the project by seeing the response again and again. Ofcourse in project we we perform a API call to request and get response.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#25 - UNDERSTANDING STATE IN CLASS BASED COMPONENTS:
constructor() {
  super();
  console.log("Hello I am a constructor"); 
}
inside constructor super() should be called mandateryly.
constructor method is executed when a object of this class is created. This constructor() is in NewsItem.js, and we have rendered NewsItem.js 3-4 times first time in News.js component. Therefore we see "Hello I am a constructor" printed 3-4 times in console. So that means how many ever times the component is used that many times object is created for that particular components class and as soon as object is created the constructor() is run. 
Therefore we see only one object of News.js as we have used <News/> component only once in App.js 

We can set state of the component in its constructor

this.state should not be set directly instead should use this.setState() to set state. Like we did in function based component.

we use this.state and this.setState() when we want something to change again and again without reloading page. So we will not set title, description etc.. as state instead will pass it a prop to the component. This is major difference between props and state.

'newsUrl' send as prop to NewsItem component will uniquely define the news. If we see in 'articles' array of 'sampleOutput.json' file we see that "url" uniquely defines the news. so we will pass "url" to "newsUrl" from News.js to NewsItem component.
