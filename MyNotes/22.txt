#22 - PROJECT 2 SETUP + INTRODUCTION TO CLASS BASED COMPONENTS:

If you want to open any folder in powershell easily: shift + rightClick (double tap in laptop) and choose open with powershell

code . -> in terminal to open that perticular folder in new vs code window.

until now it was function based components now its class based components

rfc -> function based component
rcc -> class based component 

create-react-app by default preffered function based component, we removed it in src/App.js and used class based component.

rcc->
import React, { Component } from 'react';
export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        
      </div>
    );
  }
}

In class based component state, props and other things are a bit different from function based component. If class concept is known then methods management is easier in this.

In this project we will develop a news app using API https://newsapi.org/

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#23 - COMPONENT STRUCTURE OF NEWSMONKEY REACT APP:
rce-> react class export component
import React, { Component } from 'react';
export class Navbar extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default Navbar;

render() function in src/App.js compiles JSX to html and renders it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

FETCHING API KEY FROM NEWS API:
https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started
In here we can see sample request, and response in json format. 

There are two endpoints in this api, we choose 'top headlines': see and understand all sample GET request and responses. https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844

I added json-formatter extension in google chrome.

Instead of performing GET request again and again to see the response for https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&category=sports&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844 . I store the response to this GET request in a sampleOutput.json file to ease while developing the project by seeing the response again and again. Ofcourse in project we we perform a API call to request and get response.

REACT COMPONENT LIFECYCLE AND LIFECYCLE METHODS:
 * The series of events that happen from the mounting of a React component to its Unmounting.
    *Mounting - Birth of your component
    *Update - Grouth of your component
    *Unmount - Death of your component

 Methods in React Component Lifecycle
    * The render() methos is used to render HTML of the component in react. This method is required for a class based component to render the DOM. It runs during the mounting and updating of your component. Render() method should be pure ie you cannot modify state inside it.
    * The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
    * The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens. The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate() method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
    * The componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed. Usually used to perform cleanups.
