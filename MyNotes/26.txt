#26 - LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY IN JSX:
When we use map() method and iterate over items then we have to give a unique 'key' defining item. In here we will be using "url" in "articles" array as unique identifier of each item. That is key={element.url}
and also newsUrl={element.url} as discussed earlier.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

#27 - USING FETCH API FOR HTTP CALL:
we will bring news directly from newsAPI by making GET request.

https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844
this gives response of top-headlines in india - see https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines

https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?country=in&apiKey=c4c450c08e904226a8ff20ed56c63844
this gives response of every news in india - see https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

So now will bring news from these endpoints.

componentDidMount() is a life cycle method. This method is run after render() method. And render() method runs after constructor()

Dont fetch from the API url again and again while developing as limit might get exhausted.

can use unsplash api to get image if any image is null in the response to our GET request to newsAPI. but i am using some random image https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/J6_coFbogxhRI9iM864NL_liGXvsQp2AupsKei7z0cNNfDvGUmWUy20nuUhkREQyrpY4bEeIBuc=s0-w300-rw

sampleOutput.json is not required anymore

REACT COMPONENT LIFECYCLE AND LIFECYCLE METHODS:
 * The series of events that happen from the mounting of a React component to its Unmounting.
    *Mounting - Birth of your component
    *Update - Grouth of your component
    *Unmount - Death of your component

 Methods in React Component Lifecycle
    * The render() methos is used to render HTML of the component in react. This method is required for a class based component to render the DOM. It runs during the mounting and updating of your component. Render() method should be pure ie you cannot modify state inside it.
    * The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
    * The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens. The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate() method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
    * The componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed. Usually used to perform cleanups.
